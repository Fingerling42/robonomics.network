Robonomics Winter School 2021 is inviting all willing to join master classes and lectures hosted by experienced contributors and programmers operating with Dapps and Web services on the Polkadot Parachain.

The opening ceremony will launch on Wednesday, February 10, at 7:00 PM GMT+3.

The main event with all master classes and lectures will be taking place from the 11th to the 24th of February.

## Topics to be discussed:

* What are Robonomics and Robonomics parachain? 
* How can you use a set of software for connecting IoT devices using the HTTP/MQTT protocol, complex robotic systems using the Robot Operating System (ROS)? 
* Decentralized cloud infrastructure for IoT. 
* How to create digital twins on the blockchain. 
* App Store for robotics.

Master classes include overviews of Robonomics io, using prepared digital twin templates for connecting with services, using Robonomics.js to interact via Dapps with digital twins of devices, and much more.
