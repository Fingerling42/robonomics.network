A short reminder that XRT is the main token of the Robonomics network. This is a utility token that your robotics / IoT devices can use to pay transaction fees. XRT was rated as one of the [five altcoins that are poised for massive rallies in Q1 2021](https://dailyhodl.com/2020/12/13/these-5-altcoins-are-poised-for-massive-rallies-in-q1-2021-says-popular-crypto-trader/) and Robonomics was highlighted as the most technically advanced team in the preparation process for a Polkadot parachain.
