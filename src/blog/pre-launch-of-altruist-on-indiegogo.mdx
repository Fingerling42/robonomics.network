The product is based on a scenario we've been working on for over 7 years: research, pilot launches, and testing in the field of civic air quality monitoring in cities. This is not just a new device ‚Äî it's the first step toward a smart home ecosystem where there is no place for selling user data. We put your digital freedom first: the ability to use devices without mandatory linkage to Google or Amazon clouds.    Additionally, we want to demonstrate how an open source project, supported by just a thousand users, can disrupt an entire surveillance market. We call this project the Altruist open dataset. More details about the kick-start campaign and the open dataset idea based on 'Altruists' ‚Äî in this post.

## Perks (purchase options) for Altruist on Indiegogo

We‚Äôve passed verification on Indiegogo.

Over the past two weeks, we‚Äôve prepared nearly all materials for launching the marketing campaign. Starting next week, we‚Äôll begin gathering a group of early backers for the first product from our team for end users.   
More details will be shared early next week on the Robonomics blog.

For now, here are the purchase options (called "perks" on Indiegogo):

1) **Featured Perk: Altruist Air Quality Bundle ‚Äî Early Bird**   
1x Urban + 1x Insight

**Add-ons** (options unlocked after selecting a perk): ASA UV Shield, Power Adapter with Swappable Plugs.  

   
## Altruism with long-term practical value!

Together with Altruist, we‚Äôve developed the **sensors.social** service ‚Äî an open source cloud for trusted distributed storage of user sensor data.

This is entirely optional, but if you choose to participate, the data from your outdoor sensor will be added to the **Altruist Open Data Set for Universities and NGOs** over the next 3 years.   
Our team's experience shows that just **15 to 30 Altruists** are enough to create a useful dataset for a city with over a million residents.

Thanks to the unique architecture of **sensors.social** and the Altruist device, this dataset will accumulate valuable artifacts, making Altruists a major source of urban environment quality data.
