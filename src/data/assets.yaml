  description: 'Printable monthly calendar 2021 with gorgeous cyber-girls from Anna Wimmer-Savinova. Our artist Anna Wimmer-S was inspired by modern Japanese artists and decided to turn all technologies that we use in our solutions into anime. We think that anime characters are strong, kind, brave, and stubborn. And these qualities perfectly fit our team.'
